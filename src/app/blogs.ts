            'The field of Data Science is a topic of interest amongst organizations and skilled professionals that are looking on adding skills to their  repertoire and learn how to collect data and gain meaningful insights to aid the growth of business. Data is a true asset to any organization, but only when it is processed efficiently. The requirement of storage grew unprecedentedly when we stepped into the golden era of big data. Until a decade ago, the prime focus was on developing a state of the art infrastructure to store the aforementioned valuable data, to be used to process and arrive at business insights. This gave way to frameworks such as Hadoop that took care of the storage part. Gradually the focus shifted towards the processing of this data. And this shifted the limelight on data science. Let us take a look at what data science is, and how it is relevant in today’s current state of businesses and big data.',

            'The field of Data Science is a topic of interest amongst organizations and skilled professionals that are looking on adding skills to their  repertoire and learn how to collect data and gain meaningful insights to aid the growth of business. Data is a true asset to any organization, but only when it is processed efficiently. The requirement of storage grew unprecedentedly when we stepped into the golden era of big data. Until a decade ago, the prime focus was on developing a state of the art infrastructure to store the aforementioned valuable data, to be used to process and arrive at business insights. This gave way to frameworks such as Hadoop that took care of the storage part. Gradually the focus shifted towards the processing of this data. And this shifted the limelight on data science. Let us take a look at what data science is, and how it is relevant in today’s current state of businesses and big data.',
